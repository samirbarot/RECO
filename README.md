# RECO

I have updated the application with quick solution with whatever business requirements understanding I gained based on email. I wanted to clarify before start but I guess I had no luck to discuss with anyone.

I could have used the repository and/or unit of work patterns to receive data but I have't used it. I just used quick scafolding techniques to make the app up and running.

I haven't had a chance to make any comments so I am sorry for that.

if you have any questions, please connect me on 416 277 9950.
